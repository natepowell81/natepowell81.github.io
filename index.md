## Welcome!


### About me

I am Nate Powell, I am currently a second year doctoral student in the [cognitive science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science) department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I work in Brett Fajen's [laboratory](http://panda.cogsci.rpi.edu) focusing on perception and action, more specifically computational modeling of complex behavior and brain dynamics. 

I received my bachelor's degree in Psychology and Philosophy from Binghamton University (2014) and my master's degree in Statistics from the University of Vermont (2016). While at the University of Vermont I worked in Josh Bongard's [lab](http://www.meclab.org) researching active perception and evolutionary robotics, specifically the affect of action on categorizing simple objects.
