## Welcome!


### About me

I am Nate Powell, I am currently a second year doctoral student in the cognitive science department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I work in Dr. Brett Fajen's laboratory focusing on perception and action, more specifically computational modeling of complex behavior and brain dynamics. 

I received my bachelor's degree in Psychology and Philosophy from Binghamton University (2014) and my master's degree in Statistics from the University of Vermont (2016). While at the University of Vermont I worked in Josh Bongard's lab researching active perception and evolutionary robotics, specifically the effect of action on categorizing simple objects.
