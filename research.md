## Research Interests


### Action and Perception

Broadly I am interested in human sensorimotor behavior and the coupled dynamics between human (and non-human) action capabilities and perceptual mechanisms. 

### Computational Neuroscience

I am interested in accurate representations of neuronal activity, from single cell recordings to the interactions between areas of the brain. Modeling neural activity is one way of providing evidence for plausible mechanisms by which perception and action occur. Currently I am curious about the role of prediction in the brain and whether or not it has an influence on perception or not. 

### Artificial Intelligence & Robotics

I am interested in how the above ideas can provide biological innovation and influence further research in artificial intelligence. In the past I have worked on modeling minimal cognitive abilities in evolved (virtual) robots. It was previously shown that manipulating objects allowed for faster recognition of its category. We furthered this by introducing uncertainty about what the robot *thought* the object's category was. The results showed that as the robot moved and manipulated the objects its level of uncertainty decreased, allowing for more accurate classifications of objects.
