## Research Interests


### Perception and Action

Broadly I am interested in human sensorimotor behavior and the coupled dynamics between human (and non-human) action capabilities and perceptual mechanisms. I subscribe to a pluralistic approach to understanding perception and action, examining the validity of multiple theories with respect to one another when possible.

### Computational Neuroscience

I am interested in biologically plausible representations of neuronal activity, from single cell recordings to the interactions between areas of the brain. Modeling neural activity is one way of providing evidence for plausible mechanisms by which perception and action are implemented within human neural substrates. Currently I am curious about the role of prediction in the brain and whether or not it has an influence on perceptual and action capabilities. 

### Artificial Intelligence & Robotics

I am interested in how the above ideas can provide bio-inspired innovation and push further current research in artificial intelligence. In the past I have worked on modeling minimal cognitive abilities in evolved (virtual) robots performing active categorical perception. It was previously shown that manipulating objects allowed for faster recognition of its category. We furthered this by introducing uncertainty about what categirt the robot *thought* the object's belongs. The results showed that as the robot moved and manipulated the objects its level of uncertainty decreased, allowing for more accurate and time efficent classifications of objects. 

### Other

In addition what has already been stated, I am interested in implementing statistical and graphical models. The use of deep models in cognitive science can be of great beneficial and can help find patterns were we (as humans) fail to do so[.](csns.md)
